## Getting Started

To get started with the Social Media Formatter project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


First, run the Material UI:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled firebase

```




Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
else, try these:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
